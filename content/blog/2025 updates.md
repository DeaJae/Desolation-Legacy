# 2025 updates

Not had much time to work on this, but i had some brief information given in our Desolation Legacy channel about old guilds and members, and those should be added now.

If you were on Deso on at all and want to feature on this site, contact us through [Deso Discord](https://discord.gg/z44EdeYZ3W), or the [Github project.](https://github.com/DeaJae/Desolation-Legacy/issues) 

If you are listed on here and don't want to be, or want to change any information, let us know via same methods!

## Return of April Fools!

I reuploaded the April Fools pages, least the ones what worked, and will add the indexing page to nav bar over next few days.

Not sure if I want to do one this year, bit too busy.. Not that it stopped me the last 4 times!
