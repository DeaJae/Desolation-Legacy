From June 14th World vs World finally gets its World Restructuring implemented in 'perma beta' form. This means that the current World Names are no more, which makes our community stuff redundant.

Team makeup will now be determined size of guilds who can be put together, and then people who haven't chosen a guild to represpent for that matchup.
As this system is being tested, will you end up with friends? people you know/hate? no one knows.

For the news post announcement about this, [Click here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en-gb/news/studio-update-guild-wars-2-in-spring-and-summer-2024/), and for the Wiki about World Restructuring, [click here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_Restructuring).

We'll hopefully have a write up once we experience it.
