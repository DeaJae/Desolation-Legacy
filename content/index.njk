<h2>Welcome to Desolation Legacy,</h2>

<div class="intro">This site was created to remember Guilds and Players on Desolation after World Restructuring kills named Servers in favour of Guild based teams in World vs World.
<p> This is entirely built from players memories, so a group effort is required to get everything right.
<p> We also still have the <a href="https://dc.desolation.info">Desolation Discord (Desolation DayCare or Desocord as we called it), feel free to join it and see if theres anyone you recognize!</a>

</div>
