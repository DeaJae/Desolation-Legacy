Minky has been on Deso since the start of Guild Wars 2 with his Guild Wars 1 alliance/guilds of 'BURN' (Martyrs to the Flame), who have pretty much all disappeared around 1st year of the game.

Joined Eternal Iron in 2013, part of the IRON alliance (IRON Triangle, Iron Hall, Eternal Iron), which also fell apart less than 6 months later when the leaders wanted to move everyone to another server, and didn't care much for the ones who didn't want to move.

Eternal Invictus rose from that, and that lasted for around 2 years before everyone went their own ways.

Often 'has to do bloody everything around here!' attitude to fixing the Community, giving up time and resources (old Desolation site) and still has time/energy for practical jokes invovling the discord and April Fools versions of the site despite being driven to the point of exasperation by stupid things/people.
