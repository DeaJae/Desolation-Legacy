Minky has been on Deso since the start of Guild Wars 2 with his Guild Wars 1 alliance/guilds of 'BURN' (Martyrs to the Flame), who have pretty much all disappeared now.

A community leader who gave resources to Desolation to better itself.

Often has to put a foot down when people are being too silly.
