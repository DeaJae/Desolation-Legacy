Minky has been on Deso since the start of Guild Wars 2 with his Guild Wars 1 alliance/guilds of 'BURN' (Martyrs to the Flame), who have pretty much all disappeared around 1st year of the game.
Just Eternal Iron in 2013, part of the IRON alliance (IRON Triangle, Iron Hall, Eternal Iron), which also fell apart less than 6 months later when the leaders wanted to move everyone, and didn't care much for the ones who didn't want to move.
Eternal Invictus rose from that, and that lasted for around 2 years before everyone went their own ways.

A community leader who gave resources to Desolation to better itself.

Often has to put a foot down when people are being too silly.
